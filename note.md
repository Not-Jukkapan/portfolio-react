### Rieckermann Project.

<!-- First month after access -->

Aug 3rd. Im apply at company at lower roles im Automation Enginer when 1st access my 1st job is Driving a car to send my senior to the destination (Siam City Cement Public Company Limited aka ปูนอินทรี) to adjust some SCADA and upgrade the PC. Because his car got acceident and in repair time. That make me learn a lot from watching our senior working. (Expect skill solving is the skill from escape from situation when we think it out of control and can be complete) not push self hard know self. Quick escape if it feel like it not gonna be success even you give it a 2-3 hours to it. The estimate skill that the fisrst time I learn from him.

I work as Support technical skill to our sell team (Mostly read the document and answer the Customers from sell team. And check and select compatibility of each system and hardware that customer need to use. It a junior job.)

I do like this til end of year then we got new project Migrate Welder Machine for 3K Battery (Thai Energy storage Welder machine.)

<!-- เข้ามา 2019 -->

1. Thai Energy storage Welder machine. (2019 - 2020)

This is my firstly project as Autoamtion Engineer. Task is Customer need to change they system cause it very old from old PLC SLC500 to S7-1515T old stepper to Servo system (We choose S120 as I remember) and use Remote HMI. for worker can config and doing recipe for the machine.

Our senior let me do the PLC job for I practice and learning by doing. Then he far support and doign the invertor part.
Because I new to it and dont know what acutally working with the machine and not clear the scope at first about the projects.
We got the problems that the project is late completes.
Now senior hand on the control parts instead of me. and Im going to the Error solve parts.
Cause when integrate togethor we need to clear all error even that error will not relate to the machine this time but it still will have problems at last I tihnk.

This project is on 1st covid-19 first appears in thailand (like 10 victims) We even can goback to home cause we need 4 am to go can our of the factory.
Because we late finish mean we will got a fine from factory. But we avoid that by promises to add other features to the factory.
That about adjust machine to working with other recipe and other batt size that factory not use it before.

After a serveral week we can finish it. Thank to my senior for solving the problems. Thank to our Project Engineer and Sales team that Face the customers.
It feels bad for me at the first time because as I said to you. Im not face the fails. in life as I told you im alway good even not put an effort to it. I mean it good but not best.
This project reflect we I need to put effort to it. and closely work with senior than this leanr form best.

2. October 2020 - Gislotica Spray Robot - Continental (Remote help gislotica commisioning)

The **Gislotica Spray Robot - Continental** project marked a significant turning point in my journey as an automation engineer. For the first time, I was working with international partners, which brought a new level of responsibility and communication challenges. Due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, I had to remotely assist Gislotica, a company from Portugal, in commissioning a spray robot at the Continental factory in Thailand, which manufactures car wheels.

In this project, I acted as the middleman, coordinating between Gislotica and Continental’s engineers, ensuring that everyone was aligned on the technical requirements and timelines. A major issue we faced was that the spraying material didn’t meet the original specifications, causing problems with the robot’s sprayer head. Despite these challenges and delays, we were able to overcome the technical issues and pass the necessary tests, though it took longer than expected.

This project allowed me to grow in several areas:

- **Remote Collaboration**: Managing remote tasks and acting as a bridge between international teams taught me how to effectively communicate complex technical details across language barriers and time zones.
- **Problem-Solving**: Working with non-spec materials and troubleshooting a malfunctioning robot pushed my ability to think critically and adapt to unforeseen issues.
- **Patience and Persistence**: The delays and back-and-forth coordination tested my patience, but it also reinforced the importance of persistence and follow-through.

This experience showed me how automation engineering requires not just technical skills but also excellent communication and adaptability, especially when working with global teams.

Siemens Present IOT2000
During 2020 siemens lunch the product that Call IOT 2020 , IOT 2040 IoT 2050,
Actually on my first access 2019 the product I know about it.
That Time I dont know anything else about tihs too. But Look at this It will 1st tuning point to me about why I intrest and want to become a web dev section.

When siemens lunch it like this will integrate IT/OT together customer can send data from S7-PLC to store or monitoring by using IOT2000 form simenes. They re-presnent main features is this device have many communication port and have extension aceessory to plugin to workign with other deivce liek Analog , Modbus , etc. (Focus on industry communication mainly).
And for sw parts the present the node-red. (That Time I thought it was from siemens LOL) that have lib to communicate betwwen siemens PLC and this devices (When I go deep I know it unix os name debian but that time I dont understand shit not even know dos). and for UI then in nodered it has UI Dashbarod so we can drag and drop (auotmation engineer or desktop app worker will familir to this). UI and linking the data show in UI.
That the present form siemens thailand team show us.
I got interest to this and it look very funny to work with it. and im forgot to telling you but im fan of tech channel so im now into technology field at freetimes.

<!-- 2021 -->

3. Febuary 2021 - Laemthong IoT - Webdev (Monitoring production yield.)
   The problems is the customer normally walking and use note wiritng the value that they measures and then calculcated a yield.
   So they need to centralize it and monitoring at soem point and from outside of the factory. and can print report too.
   Can store data and export and view it later.
   So after a few That I play with IOT2000 byselft that time i think it times we can work with this projects.
   For that times now I knwo the node-red is not from siemens but from someone and it can even install on my windows laptop.

As From my senior project we know about key word HTML CSS JS and webserver.
I think this project we no need iot2000 but use PC is more easiest to do a job.
This is i do first time 1 solo project (because It very small) it firsttime know Apache cause I ask my friend that work as a software engineer how people hosting their website (That Time I know xampp when I try working self playing with IOT but internet not recommennded it for productions)
My friend told he still junior like me too and not into this field but he heard most people use apache.
So I dig into it rabbit holes. By explore many tutorial and copying a code now We can host this side can access in same lan address.
Next is customer also need authN and authR Oh I forgot. About out UI (BTW that time i even know what is backend what is frontned what is UI Just know website.) I tihnk dashboard UI from node-red lib is not beautiful and flexible so. I findning a tempalte I saw one if i not worng remember it liek admin LTE that working with PHP and have login features with mysql. It try integrate that follow the tutorial in hosting it in our PC.

Then I still donw know about making the chart or integrate value update to this page.
So I use Iframe way cut form our dashboard to show it on the adminlte page. LOL .

About the stamp store data I store as csv. Yeah stole other sample code and adjust too.
About report find some script on internet that will trigger print evne.
and print only some area.

This project look small. and to many new thing for me. but it 1st project that open me to the world of dev. and after this I still digging into the IOT2000 siemens continuous.

4. March 2021 - Motor Test Stand AMR-BTS (Hipot and Winding Resistance test for motor in BTS train.)
   This project is not about the web development. It about testing the motor before overwhon when a train maintenance they need to testing motor too.
   In our testing station is about testint the Hipot , Winding resistance test, temperature vibration and hz sound of motor the three last will check when motor is running. This project we need to connect difference of measurement to the PC and controller. it make me firsttime working with VB script that pre script to communication to some equipment. and because it maintenace it need to logging data that testing and can acccess and need to make report. that first time i know sql. i heard tihs name long time ago access also but not working with it before.
   My senior doing the scada and database and report jobs. my doing the controller drive and communicate between equipments.

it has many problem from the electrical system. 1st the inverter that design size by default can make a motor running need a complex tune that out of my skill. we ask siemnes to help it and it complete. 2nd the electrical problems is trip often I dont know about this part mucj but it relate to our fuse , breaker sensitive that also make the maintenance place trip together
the thing aoubt this make me suffer it out of my controls.

5. Late 2021 - Cardinal Health - (Help Commissioning auto transfer groves machine - Working with )

This one is not a projects but about remote commissioning help with Malaysian team.
It make me grow up very much cause It a china - malay company , I need to work with malay and indian guy, only electric technicain as thai guy, but we not work closely it make me suffer very much cause im not good in english as much but just have to survives

This project also effect from covid-19 they need to improve machine perfomacne by enhance some small machien inside huge line machine for making a medicine grade groves. It first time for me to working as nightshift time. that make me growth very much. I work as a site enginner we do this project like 1 month per times but in years we do like 2 - 3 times per times at first we test some subsystem on day. and make it rely on night (that my job monitor the scada and reports some issue when night and contact to factory if something alarms). Then my malay coworker will improve system at day times.

It very suffer job cause it very hotplace and at night times too. The line very huge we neeed to walk much .

6. JBT - McKey (Fried chickern machine.)
   This is about automation project again now we working with JBT teams to control system for fryer chicken machine before freeeze and pack it in bags.
   It first time I use walkie talkie to communicate with the machine site cause we need to work together but the phone signal in that section is low.
   It make me saw how professional from automation engineer from JBT work he good at electrical side and programming side. That make me know If I need to be good in automation field it not only program but other element is need to. the mechanic also need to.
   This is also the first time PID Tunining for oil in machine that fry the chicken

<!-- my senior leave  -->

<!-- พี่เก่งไม่อยู่ 2022-->

7. March 2022 ATTG - NAWALOHA
   This project is the the factory machine product have a low success result. but they can only monitor the material and % that use then they disscuss why ? Then the engineer need database to stamp material usage % and result of that batch because now it dont have so they cant track and analysis
   The challenge is we need to tap the signal from scada and collecct it in SQL.

But from my background you see Im not exp. with that before and before this project I got suffer much because my senior was leave and other also now im only one the engineer in this teams.

But before he leave he teach me about basic CRUD for sql. and then I need to go.
The other challenge is this SCADA code is wrong it 1st mean some value of material is show wrong. we need to find the correct one.

It look not hard when looking from this view but at that time I was my firsttiem adjust other one scada, using vbscript to communicate with sQL server that first time exp.
it was a good exp. when looking from know because it make me close to a programmer wolrd from using a programming language and database.

8. April 2022 - MTT - Monexco - (Migrate S7-300 to S7-1500, change HMI)
   They need to migrate the system like mixing the material of a Noodle pack together.
   This project is my 1st time handon of the project( a Technical not on sales or project management parts). because our senior is leave now.
   Tihs porject is migrate system from old to now. the challelgen is working with old HMI that has heartbeat time. we now this later and we not even have a source code of all system just have some. That the point. This project make me grow much because it only me now to make this complete.

The problem is also about the some equipment that use for measure the weight that break but no one know.
And The interter that was blast in frontoff me when turning the cabinet on. Man it very scare when think back. It because taht room is very wet.

As you see the problems is from various thing that out of my controls. That make me very suffer but BTW we passing it and complete it.

9. TCP กระทิงแดง อ.บางน้ำเปรี้ยว
   From PLC HMI and IoT2000 siemens
   After long time we dont have an Web like this project. But now we got one. this was the first time i use iot2000 series from siemens at work.
   This time instead of using a lib dashboard that can drag and drop in Node-red #note we still use node-red as main. and dont know shit about frontnend backend just a website that i know.
   I found a lib UI- Builder that user can create own site by HTML CSS JS and running in node-red. and I know about SVG file.
   This two idea open my world widely first the UI-Builder in tutorial that I found he use vue2. That the first time im hearing it.
   also have example about svelte and vanilaJS. But the vue2 tutorial have most views so I choose that one lol. but I still dont know about what vue2 is That time the tutorial just one pages example show how they integrate data from node-red to the UI-Buider lib that using vue2 get data and show data. and how they listen event that do on UI-Builder and pass it to node-red ## note Node-red is like a flow chart low code sw that run on nodejs but that time i dont know shit just know node-red.

I use vue2 with uibuilder but use like Multipage application mean we have 1 fodler for one page that foder have index.html .css .js
and in .js we use vue2 tempalte script instead.
That very weird but because I dont know shit I use that way.

About svg because we come from autoamtion world that showing machine status , sensor values .... Mean we need to show it in website too.
We found some tutorial again about SVG Scada that use svg file. I dig to it and know what it is. We foudn some lib that can integeirate node-red value with SVG file by binding to id of element that need to update (from now I tihnk like selectById and do soemtihng.)
and I use old may. iframe again that svg file to our UI-Builders. this project has no storign I forgot just show. and can update some value via our site to a system.

10. Dec 2022 - DTS - BMW - TYSK (Thyssenkrupp) - (Help commissioning and adjust some HMI for Eletrcial car battery.)
    This not a project but commissiong that was very suffer than before because we woking with a european team /Thyssenkrupp , DTS and BWM about help them commissioning assembly line for electrical car battery. The main serous thing is the laguage barriers and TMO standard that require for working with BMW standard for autoamtions (chat you search it what it is TMO) I grow much from learnign form a real world class professional team.

11. April 2023 - Mitsubishi - Emerson- Vibration Logging, Alert and prepared data to ThingWorx
    This one is the vibration company will install they vibration system to the machine in Mitsubishi thailand.
    and for enhance the values they need the logging system and sending data to the factory IT and alert when it reach the setpoint.

This project we just program it the software and hardware not we select they only look for a programmer to do it.

They chosse all from emerson. I dont have any knowledge about emerson but now I need to digingign in it .
Emerson have moviconNext like a Program to make HMI and can build as web app too. It any tutorail on internet very few. very hard to follow it need trial and errors and follow my sense and read the docuemnts for using that program.
because we dont know the hardware what they choose but we need to finish demo for testing show a mitsu team.

We choose MSSQL because it our familiar now. When testing demo show it pass by goods.

But hell come to use. When we received the hardware man... The PC was touch PC and the spec is very poors.
when we install and start the SQL. Then Touch panels are slow like a .....
Man this can finish the project for sure because when we enter even a first page it took 5 -10 minute to open it
we change to mysql but it still took many minutes too. the deadlines come

BTW know I know the name that call "Components" so I ask them we can build this one instead of using this app I tihnk it will takes low spec than it.
So I try so hard using node-red uibuilder and vue working with it.

BUt yeah I wrong estimate. The project not finish before deadlines man it feeling very bad for me. It like use you 150% of you but it still failed.
even after that I complete it and testing run. Then Touch PC still lagging. That mean my code is very bad. Now I know only can build the web is enough but it need to be good. and optimize.

This project end up with buying new Panel and using old program from emerson I learnnnn a lot about this project.
Sometimes dont forces it hards. It will got bad results than .

12. May 2023 - Vonbundit - (Logging and Monitoring data, Historian trend and can export as CSV.)
13. Ajinomoto - Vibration Logging - (Logging and Monitoring data, Historian trend and can export as CSV.)
14. Sep 2023 - CPF - Betain - วัด Fluid ตอน valve เปิด - Chaiudom
    This is Im digging into this like rabbit whole now i know about what is dos what is unix system I know out iot2000 using debian know about nodejs
    try to install it. Now I know about backend frontned what is it so. I need some challenge and want to try myself
    this project I dont use familiar stack that we can success from two project previous
    I know i love building web like this so i try building real vue app instead building in uibuilder and node-red
    I use express + nodejs as my backend with mssql. Thsi project we hand on from other team. So I can follow they design
    after building like 50% I face for this now the vuetify ui framework for vue3 data-table is not release yet.
    That time I only know finding the UI-Component lib not trying to build one as self man... if we cant use data-table
    I dont know how I will show a database to the user. So I choose to use quasar instead vuetify and re building our frontend app again.

if very hard because I'm having exp in vuetify2 before when building previous project but quasar is first time and we have deadline limits.

BTW got a bit suffer but can stil complete the frontend side.

THE backend is hard than I expect.
As I mention all previous project we use node-red as backend - it like a low code just drag and drop. but now we need to build our API by self.
that make our code look very spcketti (from my code for now is spaketti too like before lol). But thank to ChatGPT we can completet this projects on times.

15. Late 2023 - Betterpharma Dosa - (Update SCADA system for premix line, migrate system from XP to 11)

This project was HUGE. It migrate Dosa system from Window Xp to 11.
It a batch control system. Working with Factory DB server, PLC , whole 5 floors machine and report.
Old system user Delphi7, object pascal, mssql (forgot version) wonderware , S7-400 PLC and crystal reports.
1st of all this project was run on 2005 until now (2023 at that time I do this project)
the company that do this system The company has closed down. but the factory need to migrate system because it very old now and very slow when startup the system.

Our plan is we sub job to a professional wonderware programmer to do that job, my senior doing network and pLC I do about the Delphi programs.
It have 4 program working together, name DosaData, DosaSetting, DosaProduction, DosaServer we need to convert all this for newer version
but it major chnage the delphi change concept of compile and about data memory. so we cant convert it and not event write it new because im new to Delphi too. Lucky that old software we found a way to make it run on 11 but need to adjust some sychnonous time between software because now the windows 11 and new pc is very fast. that program because it working with many program so it not have a quece stack of process better it use time sych.
we need to optimize and put delay on some process.

About other system also got problem too. First the communication card between PC and PLC was obsolete now we need to change the Protocol.
We select new and use it and find in Wonderware if we change communication use that one will adjust whole program like rewrite it about tags
because it use too many indirect way to access data from memory instead direct way declear so we can use like this. (From Profibus with special card into Profinet). We use OPC software instead it to sole the problems.

Now the wonderware side can work but my side is face problems now. Because our connection string is and format data is for Connect to the old one system
but now we change it to OPC ... forgot the name brand, I need to adjust and reformat of all tags.

From this projet im very suffer and we work like to 4 am every days.
it make me suffer .

It most diffucult project in my life.

<!-- Feb 2024 -->

I quip job and take a bootcamp to be a frontned/ fullstack programs. you know even im on that project but I still have time to watching some web tutorial videoes LOL

<!-- 2024 -->

16. ### Part 1: Project Reflection (For Reading and Understanding)

The **Turnixx Project** (May - September 2024) was a personal full-stack development project I built specifically as part of my job search. I wanted to demonstrate my ability to handle a full project lifecycle, from the backend to the frontend, using modern tools like **React**, **TypeScript**, **MySQL**, and **Node-Express**. Initially, I planned to complete it in two months, but the reality was much different—it took four months.

In the early stages, I faced a major roadblock because I didn't design the project thoroughly before starting. I quickly realized that I didn’t know what pages were needed, what data would be sent to and from the backend, and how it would all come together. After a week of frustration, I paused development to spend a month designing the project, making sketches, and thinking through the data flow.

I then began by building the backend, but I took a more old-fashioned approach by writing raw SQL queries. This led to many errors, which were hard to trace, and I struggled to understand whether the problem lay in my code logic, SQL commands, or just simple typos. After several setbacks, I switched to using **Prisma**, which helped structure my database and made querying easier.

During this process, I encountered burnout and took a brief break. I returned refreshed and ready to push through. I also struggled with the frontend design, where I spent two weeks searching for a UI that worked. In the end, I followed a YouTube tutorial on **TailwindCSS** and HTML for an e-commerce theme and applied that design to Turnixx.

For backend integration, I realized there was more complexity than expected. So, instead of building my own book data API, I used the **OpenLibrary API** and persisted mock user data with **Zustand**. This allowed me to complete the project and show my skills in full-stack development, from database structure to frontend integration.

**Key Takeaways**:

- **Full Lifecycle Learning**: This project taught me the importance of planning and designing a project before jumping into development, especially when working solo.
- **Overcoming Technical Challenges**: Switching from raw SQL to Prisma was a major pivot, but it made the project more structured and maintainable.
- **Dealing with Burnout**: This project was emotionally challenging, but taking a break and returning with a clear mind helped me finish.
- **Design Struggles**: While I’m not naturally a designer, I followed external tutorials to create a visually appealing and functional frontend using TailwindCSS.
