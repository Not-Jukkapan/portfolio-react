2. October 2020 - Gislotica Spray Robot - Continental (Remote help gislotica commisioning)

The **Gislotica Spray Robot - Continental** project marked a significant turning point in my journey as an automation engineer. For the first time, I was working with international partners, which brought a new level of responsibility and communication challenges. Due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, I had to remotely assist Gislotica, a company from Portugal, in commissioning a spray robot at the Continental factory in Thailand, which manufactures car wheels.

In this project, I acted as the middleman, coordinating between Gislotica and Continental’s engineers, ensuring that everyone was aligned on the technical requirements and timelines. A major issue we faced was that the spraying material didn’t meet the original specifications, causing problems with the robot’s sprayer head. Despite these challenges and delays, we were able to overcome the technical issues and pass the necessary tests, though it took longer than expected.

This project allowed me to grow in several areas:

- **Remote Collaboration**: Managing remote tasks and acting as a bridge between international teams taught me how to effectively communicate complex technical details across language barriers and time zones.
- **Problem-Solving**: Working with non-spec materials and troubleshooting a malfunctioning robot pushed my ability to think critically and adapt to unforeseen issues.
- **Patience and Persistence**: The delays and back-and-forth coordination tested my patience, but it also reinforced the importance of persistence and follow-through.

This experience showed me how automation engineering requires not just technical skills but also excellent communication and adaptability, especially when working with global teams.

3. ### Part 1: Project Reflection (For Reading and Understanding)

The **Laemthong IoT - Webdev** project in February 2021 was a pivotal moment for me because it was my first solo project, and it opened the door to web development. The customer needed a solution to centralize production yield data, store it, monitor it from outside the factory, and generate reports—features that were missing from their manual, paper-based process.

By this point, I had been experimenting with Siemens’ IOT2000, but I realized that using a PC with Apache would be a more suitable solution for this project. With no formal knowledge of backend or frontend development, I dived into tutorials and began exploring how to host websites and build dashboards. I quickly discovered Apache, thanks to a recommendation from a friend, and began learning how to host a website within the LAN.

The project had several key challenges:
- **Authentication and Authorization**: I needed to implement user login, and after exploring available templates, I settled on Admin LTE, which worked with PHP and MySQL. While I followed tutorials to integrate these, it was my first exposure to authN and authR.
- **Data Display**: I wasn’t sure how to integrate dynamic data into the dashboard, so I used an iframe to display the Node-RED dashboard within the admin template.
- **Data Storage and Reporting**: For data storage, I used CSV files and borrowed code samples from online tutorials. For reporting, I found a script that triggered print events, allowing only specific sections of the dashboard to be printed.

Though small and filled with new concepts, this project introduced me to the basics of web development. It was the first time I saw how IoT and web-based tools could work together, and it gave me the confidence to continue exploring the world of development.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **First Steps into Web Development**: This was my entry into web technologies like Apache, HTML, CSS, and PHP, and the experience laid the groundwork for my eventual move into web development.
- **Problem-Solving and Self-Learning**: I had to solve problems independently, often through trial and error, which helped me develop a resilient mindset and a willingness to learn.
- **Opening Up to Dev Tools**: Though I started by simply copying code and following tutorials, this project opened my eyes to how much I could achieve by learning and integrating different tools and technologies.

4. ### Part 1: Project Reflection (For Reading and Understanding)

The **Motor Test Stand AMR-BTS** project in March 2021 was primarily focused on testing the motors used in BTS trains as part of their maintenance routine. The project required testing several parameters of the motors, such as Hipot, winding resistance, temperature, vibration, and sound frequency, with some tests occurring while the motor was running.

This project was technically challenging and introduced me to new concepts, particularly around equipment communication and data logging. Although we didn’t work directly with VBScript, we used the logic derived from VBScript examples to understand how equipment communicates. From there, I applied that understanding to set up communication between the equipment, PLC, and laptop using RS232.

Key challenges included:
- **Inverter Tuning**: The inverter, which was required to run the motor, needed complex tuning that was beyond my skillset. Siemens was brought in to resolve this issue.
- **Frequent Electrical Trips**: We faced frequent electrical trips due to sensitive fuses and breakers. While I couldn’t directly solve these issues, I learned the importance of understanding how electrical components can affect overall system performance.

This project expanded my skill set in several ways:
- **RS232 Communication**: I learned how to establish communication between testing equipment, the PLC, and the laptop using RS232. This knowledge was critical for connecting the system components and ensuring smooth data flow.
- **SQL for Data Logging**: This was my first exposure to SQL, as I helped set up data logging for the motor tests. Understanding how to store and retrieve test data laid the groundwork for future projects involving databases and data management.

While this project didn’t involve web development, it gave me essential technical experience in communication protocols, data logging, and troubleshooting.

5. ### Part 1: Project Reflection (For Reading and Understanding)

The **Cardinal Health Commissioning** project in late 2021 was a unique and challenging experience that helped me grow both personally and professionally. Unlike other projects, this wasn’t a full-scale engineering project but rather a remote commissioning collaboration with a Malaysian team. The goal was to enhance the performance of a massive machine used in the production of medical-grade gloves.

The main challenge was the language barrier and cultural differences. The team consisted of Malaysian and Indian engineers, with only a Thai electrical technician on site, whom I didn’t work closely with. I had to navigate these challenges, relying on my technical knowledge while improving my English communication skills. Despite the difficulties, I learned how to survive and adapt in a multicultural, remote work environment.

Another significant aspect of this project was working the night shift. My primary responsibility was to monitor the SCADA system, report any issues or alarms, and contact the factory during the night. This was the first time I worked in such conditions, and it was physically and mentally demanding due to the heat and the large area we had to cover.

The project involved several trips over the course of a year, each lasting about a month, with the focus on testing subsystems during the day and relying on them at night. This rhythm helped me develop resilience and the ability to work independently, especially in less-than-ideal conditions.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Improved English Communication**: Working in a multicultural team under challenging conditions forced me to adapt and improve my communication skills.
- **Resilience and Adaptability**: The demanding nature of the job, from night shifts to working in hot environments, strengthened my ability to endure difficult situations.

7. ### Part 1: Project Reflection (For Reading and Understanding)

The **ATTG - NAWALOHA** project in March 2022 was a pivotal moment in my journey because it pushed me into a leadership role when my senior left, making me the sole engineer responsible for the task. The challenge was to help the factory understand why their production success rates were low. While they could monitor material usage percentages, they had no system in place to track or analyze the results of each batch. My job was to tap into the SCADA signals and log material usage data and batch results into an SQL database, something the factory had never done before.

This project was full of challenges:
- **SCADA Code Issues**: The SCADA system itself was not reliable, showing incorrect values for material usage, which meant I had to first troubleshoot and correct the SCADA code. It was the first time I had to adjust someone else’s SCADA code, which felt daunting at the time.
- **New SQL Experience**: Although my senior had briefly taught me CRUD operations with SQL before leaving, this was my first time applying it in a real-world scenario. Using VBScript to communicate with the SQL server was completely new to me, and it pushed me further into the programming world.
- **Leadership Pressure**: With no senior engineer to rely on, I had to step up and take full responsibility for the project, a significant shift in my role.

Looking back, this project was a major step toward the world of programming and databases. While it felt overwhelming at the time, I gained valuable experience in using SQL, VBScript, and SCADA, which helped me become more self-reliant and confident in my abilities as an engineer.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **First Real Programming Experience**: This project marked the first time I fully used SQL and VBScript in a practical setting, bridging the gap between automation and programming.
- **Troubleshooting SCADA Systems**: I learned how to adjust existing SCADA systems, debug code, and correct material usage values, which was a new technical challenge for me.
- **Leadership and Independence**: With my senior gone, I had to step up and lead the project, which was a significant personal and professional growth experience.

8. ### Part 1: Project Reflection (For Reading and Understanding)

The **MTT - Monexco** project in April 2022 was my first fully hands-on technical project after the departure of my senior, making this a pivotal experience in my journey. The goal was to migrate a system from S7-300 to S7-1500 and update the HMI for a material mixing process in noodle production. This project was full of challenges and unexpected problems, which forced me to grow significantly as an engineer.

One of the key difficulties was working with an old HMI that had a heartbeat timer—a detail we only discovered later in the project. On top of that, we didn’t have the full source code of the original system, which meant I had to figure things out as I went, often without crucial information. Being the only engineer responsible for this project added immense pressure, but it also pushed me to become more resourceful and confident in my abilities.

Several other unexpected problems arose, such as a broken weight measurement tool that no one was aware of until it became an issue. The most frightening incident was when an inverter exploded right in front of me after I turned the cabinet on, likely due to the wet conditions in the room. That was a scary moment that reminded me of the importance of safety in such environments.

Despite these obstacles—many of which were beyond my control—I was able to complete the project successfully. This experience taught me how to handle complex technical challenges independently, and it reinforced my problem-solving skills under pressure.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **First Fully Hands-On Technical Project**: This project marked the first time I was fully responsible for the technical aspects, from migration to HMI updates, without any direct supervision.
- **Handling Unforeseen Problems**: From missing source code to equipment malfunctions, I learned how to navigate unexpected issues and keep the project on track.
- **Safety Awareness**: The explosion of the inverter highlighted the importance of safety in high-risk environments, something I’ll never forget.

9. TCP กระทิงแดง อ.บางน้ำเปรี้ยว
   From PLC HMI and IoT2000 siemens
   After long time we dont have an Web like this project. But now we got one. this was the first time i use iot2000 series from siemens at work.
   This time instead of using a lib dashboard that can drag and drop in Node-red #note we still use node-red as main. and dont know shit about frontnend backend just a website that i know.
   I found a lib UI- Builder that user can create own site by HTML CSS JS and running in node-red. and I know about SVG file.
   This two idea open my world widely first the UI-Builder in tutorial that I found he use vue2. That the first time im hearing it.
   also have example about svelte and vanilaJS. But the vue2 tutorial have most views so I choose that one lol. but I still dont know about what vue2 is That time the tutorial just one pages example show how they integrate data from node-red to the UI-Buider lib that using vue2 get data and show data. and how they listen event that do on UI-Builder and pass it to node-red ## note Node-red is like a flow chart low code sw that run on nodejs but that time i dont know shit just know node-red.

I use vue2 with uibuilder but use like Multipage application mean we have 1 fodler for one page that foder have index.html .css .js
and in .js we use vue2 tempalte script instead.
That very weird but because I dont know shit I use that way.

About svg because we come from autoamtion world that showing machine status , sensor values .... Mean we need to show it in website too.
We found some tutorial again about SVG Scada that use svg file. I dig to it and know what it is. We foudn some lib that can integeirate node-red value with SVG file by binding to id of element that need to update (from now I tihnk like selectById and do soemtihng.)
and I use old may. iframe again that svg file to our UI-Builders. this project has no storign I forgot just show. and can update some value via our site to a system.

11. ### Part 1: Project Reflection (For Reading and Understanding)

The **Mitsubishi - Emerson Vibration Logging** project in April 2023 was a challenging learning experience that tested both my technical skills and my ability to deal with hardware limitations. The goal was to create a system for logging vibration data, sending alerts when setpoints were reached, and integrating the data with the factory IT system using ThingWorx. While Emerson provided the hardware and software, my role was to develop the system that would make it all work together.

This project introduced me to Emerson’s MoviconNext software, which was entirely new to me and had very little documentation or tutorials available. I had to rely on trial and error, reading whatever resources I could find, and trusting my instincts to make progress. I initially developed a demo using MSSQL for data logging, and the demo passed the initial testing phase.

However, the real problems began when we received the hardware—a low-spec touch PC. Installing SQL and running the system on this machine caused massive performance issues. Opening even the first page took five to ten minutes, making it clear that the project couldn’t succeed with the current hardware.

In an attempt to resolve the issue, I proposed rebuilding the system using Node-RED, uibuilder, and Vue, believing that this approach would be more efficient and work better with the limited hardware. Unfortunately, my estimate was wrong, and the project didn’t meet the deadline. It was a hard lesson in overworking a solution that wasn’t the right fit. Even though I completed the system later, the performance issues persisted, and the project ultimately required a hardware upgrade to resolve the problems.

This project was a tough experience, but it taught me a lot about the importance of understanding hardware limitations and the need for optimized solutions, not just functional ones.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Trial and Error Learning**: Without sufficient documentation, I had to rely on intuition and self-learning to use Emerson’s MoviconNext software, which broadened my problem-solving skills.
- **Hardware Limitations**: I learned the importance of understanding the impact of hardware on software performance, especially in resource-limited environments.
- **Knowing When to Adapt**: This project showed me the importance of finding the right balance between pushing hard for a solution and knowing when to step back and reconsider the approach.

The **Vonbundit Data Logging and Monitoring** project in May 2023 was a straightforward project compared to previous ones, as it mainly involved reusing and adjusting code from earlier work. The goal was to create a system for logging data, monitoring it in real-time, generating historian trend visualizations, and allowing the data to be exported as CSV files. 

For this project, I used the same stack I had worked with before: MSSQL for data storage, Node-RED for managing the data flow, and uibuilder with Vue 2 for building the web interface. Because the technology and codebase were familiar to me, the project didn’t present as many challenges or opportunities for learning new skills. 

While I didn’t learn much technically, this project reinforced the value of building reusable code that can be adapted to new contexts. It also highlighted how efficient development becomes when you have a reliable stack and can quickly adjust existing code to meet project requirements.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Code Reusability**: This project demonstrated the value of writing adaptable, reusable code, which can be applied to new projects with minimal modifications.
- **Efficiency in Familiar Stacks**: By relying on a familiar stack, I was able to complete this project quickly and efficiently, further solidifying my understanding of the technologies I had already mastered.

The **Ajinomoto Vibration Logging** project in 2023 was similar to the Vonbundit project in terms of functionality, involving logging and monitoring vibration data, visualizing historical trends, and exporting data as CSV files. However, this project presented a new challenge during the SQL setup. Initially, we planned to use MSSQL, but after running into configuration issues, I decided to switch to PostgreSQL—a technology I had heard about during the Cardinal Health project from the Malaysian team.

This was my first time working with PostgreSQL, and migrating the system over to this new database required some extra effort. Once the migration was successful, the project proceeded smoothly. The project was small in scale, but it allowed me to add PostgreSQL to my toolkit, which broadened my database management skills.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Learning and Adapting to New Tools**: This project introduced me to PostgreSQL, expanding my knowledge of database systems and showing me the importance of being adaptable.
- **Problem Solving and Migration**: When issues with MSSQL arose, I was able to pivot and successfully migrate the system to a new database platform, demonstrating resilience and adaptability.

14. ### Part 1: Project Reflection (For Reading and Understanding)

The **CPF - Betain Fluid Measurement** project in September 2023 was a major turning point in my journey as a developer. It was the first time I stepped away from using Node-RED and uibuilder, opting instead to build a more traditional web application with **Vue 3** for the frontend and **Express** with **Node.js** for the backend, using **MSSQL** for the database. This project allowed me to dig deeper into web development concepts like backend and frontend architecture.

At first, I faced a challenge when I realized that the **Vuetify** UI framework for **Vue 3** didn’t have a ready-to-use data table component, which was crucial for displaying database content. Having used Vuetify in earlier projects, this limitation threw me off, but I decided to switch to **Quasar**, a new framework for me at the time, and reworked the frontend. This was a tough but valuable experience, especially with the added pressure of meeting a tight deadline.

The backend side was even more difficult than I had anticipated. Unlike my previous projects, where I used the low-code environment of Node-RED to handle backend logic, this time I had to build the **API** from scratch using **Node.js** and **Express**. The result was somewhat "spaghetti" code, but it was a learning opportunity. Thanks to some timely guidance from ChatGPT, I was able to complete the project on time.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **First Full Stack Project**: This was the first project where I built both the frontend and backend without relying on low-code tools, significantly expanding my technical abilities.
- **Overcoming UI Limitations**: Switching from Vuetify to Quasar was a major challenge, but it taught me the importance of being adaptable when using different frameworks.
- **API Development**: This project marked my first experience building an API from scratch, which was a tough but valuable learning process.

15. ### Part 1: Project Reflection (For Reading and Understanding)

The **Betterpharma Dosa System Migration** project in late 2023 was by far the most complex and challenging project I’ve faced in my career. It involved migrating a batch control system that had been running on Windows XP since 2005 to Windows 11. The system managed everything from the Factory DB server and PLC to machines spanning five floors, and it was deeply integrated with Wonderware, S7-400 PLCs, Delphi 7 applications, and Crystal Reports. 

One of the biggest challenges was that the company that originally developed the system had closed, leaving us with outdated and poorly documented software. The system consisted of four Delphi applications that controlled various parts of the production process—DosaData, DosaSetting, DosaProduction, and DosaServer. Although we initially tried to convert these to a newer Delphi version, the drastic changes in how Delphi handled memory and compilation meant it was impossible. Instead, we found a way to make the existing programs run on Windows 11 by tweaking synchronization times to account for the faster processing speeds of modern machines.

On top of that, we had to replace the obsolete communication card between the PC and PLC and move from Profibus to Profinet, which required rewriting large portions of the Wonderware system. The use of OPC software helped bridge this gap, but it also required significant adjustments to the Wonderware tags and the communication setup.

This project pushed me to my limits. We worked late nights—often until 4 AM—and faced one technical challenge after another, from rewriting communication protocols to reformatting tags and connection strings to make everything work in the updated environment. This project was an intense learning experience and the most difficult project of my career so far.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Complex System Migration**: This was my first experience migrating such a complex system across multiple platforms and software that was nearly two decades old.
- **Legacy Systems and Modern Hardware**: The need to adapt outdated software to work on modern hardware taught me valuable lessons in system optimization, synchronization, and backward compatibility.
- **Resilience and Problem-Solving**: The sheer number of challenges—from communication protocol changes to synchronization issues—tested my problem-solving abilities and forced me to find creative solutions under immense pressure.

16. ### Part 1: Project Reflection (For Reading and Understanding)

The **Turnixx Project** (May - September 2024) was a personal full-stack development project I built specifically as part of my job search. I wanted to demonstrate my ability to handle a full project lifecycle, from the backend to the frontend, using modern tools like **React**, **TypeScript**, **MySQL**, and **Node-Express**. Initially, I planned to complete it in two months, but the reality was much different—it took four months.

In the early stages, I faced a major roadblock because I didn't design the project thoroughly before starting. I quickly realized that I didn’t know what pages were needed, what data would be sent to and from the backend, and how it would all come together. After a week of frustration, I paused development to spend a month designing the project, making sketches, and thinking through the data flow.

I then began by building the backend, but I took a more old-fashioned approach by writing raw SQL queries. This led to many errors, which were hard to trace, and I struggled to understand whether the problem lay in my code logic, SQL commands, or just simple typos. After several setbacks, I switched to using **Prisma**, which helped structure my database and made querying easier.

During this process, I encountered burnout and took a brief break. I returned refreshed and ready to push through. I also struggled with the frontend design, where I spent two weeks searching for a UI that worked. In the end, I followed a YouTube tutorial on **TailwindCSS** and HTML for an e-commerce theme and applied that design to Turnixx.

For backend integration, I realized there was more complexity than expected. So, instead of building my own book data API, I used the **OpenLibrary API** and persisted mock user data with **Zustand**. This allowed me to complete the project and show my skills in full-stack development, from database structure to frontend integration.

**Key Takeaways**:

- **Full Lifecycle Learning**: This project taught me the importance of planning and designing a project before jumping into development, especially when working solo.
- **Overcoming Technical Challenges**: Switching from raw SQL to Prisma was a major pivot, but it made the project more structured and maintainable.
- **Dealing with Burnout**: This project was emotionally challenging, but taking a break and returning with a clear mind helped me finish.
- **Design Struggles**: While I’m not naturally a designer, I followed external tutorials to create a visually appealing and functional frontend using TailwindCSS.
