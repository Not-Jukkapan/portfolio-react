### Rieckermann Project.

<!-- First month after access -->
Aug 3rd. Im apply at company at lower roles im Automation Enginer when 1st access my 1st job is Driving a car to send my senior to the destination (Siam City Cement Public Company Limited aka ปูนอินทรี) to adjust some SCADA and upgrade the PC. Because his car got acceident and in repair time. That make me learn a lot from watching our senior working. (Expect skill solving is the skill from escape from situation when we think it out of control and can be complete) not push self hard know self. Quick escape if it feel like it not gonna be success even you give it a 2-3 hours to it. The estimate skill that the fisrst  time I learn from him.

I work as Support technical skill to our sell team (Mostly read the document and answer the Customers from sell team. And check and select compatibility of each system and hardware that customer need to use. It a junior job.)

I do like this til end of year then we got new project Migrate Welder Machine for 3K Battery (Thai Energy storage Welder machine.)

<!-- เข้ามา 2019 -->
1) Thai Energy storage Welder machine. (2019 - 2020)

This is my firstly project as Autoamtion Engineer. Task is Customer need to change they system cause it very old from old PLC  SLC500 to S7-1515T old stepper to Servo system (We choose S120 as I remember) and use Remote HMI. for worker can config and doing recipe for the machine.

Our senior let me do the PLC job for I practice and learning by doing. Then he far support and doign the invertor part.
Because I new to it and dont know what acutally working with the machine and not clear the scope at first about the projects.
We got the problems that the project is late completes.
Now senior hand on the control parts instead of me. and Im going to the Error solve parts.
Cause when integrate togethor we need to clear all error even that error will not relate to the machine this time but it still will have problems at last I tihnk. 

This project is on 1st covid-19 first appears in thailand (like 10 victims) We even can goback to home cause we need 4 am to go can our of the factory. 
Because we late finish mean we will got a fine from factory. But we avoid that by promises to add other features to the factory.
That about adjust machine to working with other recipe and other batt size that factory not use it before.

After a serveral week we can finish it. Thank to my senior for solving the problems. Thank to our Project Engineer and Sales team that Face the customers.
It feels bad for me at the first time because as I said to you. Im not face the fails. in life as I told you im alway good even not put an effort to it. I mean it good but not best. 
This project reflect we I need to put effort to it. and closely work with senior than this leanr form best.
